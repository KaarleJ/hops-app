# Hops-app backend

This is the backend for the HopsApp. The app is used to plan studies. The core functionality is a calendar which consists of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies. Courses can be added, edited and removed.
Project frontend [here](https://github.com/KaarleJ/hops-app-frontend).

## Development

The backend was developed with TypeScript, NodeJs, ExpressJs, Apollo GQL and MongoDB. I used Jest and Cypress for unit and E2E tests.

This app is deployed on fly.io [here](https://hops.fly.dev/).
